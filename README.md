# Back-Prop-Fast-Transform-Neural-Network
Fast Transform (aka Fixed Filter Bank) Neural Network using Back-Propagation.

I have hardly ever used/tried back-propagation.  I use evolution algorithm nearly exclusively.

However I felt obligated to try it with the Fast Transform neural networks, to see if they could even be trained with back-propagation.  
And the answer is yes they can. Even on a crude first attempt it worked quite well.

I can definitely give a green light to use back-propagation with Fast Transform Neural Networks.

The code is in FreeBasic 1.07.1

I'll convert the code to some other programming languages over time.  I need to study up on back-propagation in finer detail too.
