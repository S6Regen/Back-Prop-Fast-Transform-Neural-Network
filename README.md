# Back-Prop-Fast-Transform-Neural-Network
Fast Transform (aka Fixed Filter Bank) Neural Network using Back-Propagation.

I have hardly ever used/tried back-propagation.  I am more or less use evolution algorithm exclusively.
However I felt obligated to try it with the Fast Transform neural networks, to see if they could even be trained with back-propagation.  
And the answer is yes they can. Even on a crude first attempt. Certainly evolution is very slow in comparison even with things proceeding smoothly. 
I can definitely give a green light to use back-propagation to train Fast Transform Neural Networks.
